# CLEFIP-0.54M
Subpart of CLEFIP 2011 test collection for patent classification

The dataset contains 6 csv files with data coming from 541,131 patents. Each csv file has two columns; the main IPC code at level-4 column and the text from a patent field, i.e., abstract, description, claims, title, applicants and inventors.

This content comes from the latest documents/versions of these 541,131 patents that have simultaneously an EN abstract, EN description, EN claims, EN title, applicants and inventors. Moreover, the text of EN abstract, EN description, and EN claims has undergone a further preprocessing removing any character that is not alphabetic and removing English stopwords.
